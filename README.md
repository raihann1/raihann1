## Hi there 👋

I'm Raihan, a **Computer Science** student at the City College of New York.

🔭 Currently, I am learning AI Essentials, Networking, and Cloud Computing through hands- learning labs.

Check out my projects:


🔐 [LinkSage](https://github.com/raihann1/LinkSage) - A powerful, stateless Discord bot designed to enhance safety and privacy in Discord servers. Built entirely on **Cloudflare Workers**, it integrates via **slash commands** and **message context menu commands** (User Apps), allowing users to analyze links without having to click on them.
